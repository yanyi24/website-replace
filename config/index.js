I had an SBS 2011\n                    Server that was 2500 miles away, in Alaska, and it was quickly reaching critical low disk space on the\n                    system partition. Using Partition Assistant Server, I was able to repair the problem via Remote Desktop\n                    and a Cisco IPSec VPN. I will definitely use this product again it will always be highly recommended to\n                    my colleagues. Thanks you again.","c513":"Nicholas Stein","c514":"California, USA","c518":"First I want to say how much I appreciate your partition manager. I have used many other software to try\n                    to move partitions around and they never quite work for me. As a system admin, partitions are always painful\n                    and you have made my life easier. I will try to get my company to go for the enterprise server edition.","c532":"Learn more","c540":"Media Reviews","c543":"AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard Edition lets you manage your hard drives with ease, regardless of your prior exper-ience\n            and, if you know your way around, advanced features like file system converters are at your fingertips.
